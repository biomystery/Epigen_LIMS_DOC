## Library name convention

1. Named using `initials_nth`: e.g.: `JYH_123` 

## Seq name convention

Because each sequencing is derivated from a library, the sequence id
need match with the library's id. By default, we thought the library
is only sequence once, so **always** the first sequencing id is
idential to the library ID (i.e. No `JYH_123_1` for the first
sequencing). Then the next sequencing made from the same library named
as "JYH_123_2" and etc. 

## Pooled libraries
The pooled lirary should be named as `JYH_123_1_2` and etc. For
`JYH_123_1_2`, it means to pool `JYH_123` and `JYH_123_2` togather. If
you want to pool `JYH_123` and `JYH_123_3` togather, then the name
should be `JYH_123_1_3`.
